# HTML_PROJECTS-

I developed a fully functional calculator using HTML and CSS, showcasing my ability to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. Following that, I took on the challenge of building my own portfolio website, utilizing a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills and projects in a visually appealing manner.

Continuing the learning journey, I designed a landing page with similarities to my portfolio, demonstrating versatility in web design and development. These projects not only provided me with practical experience in front-end technologies but also allowed me to explore the creative aspects of web development.

Through my internship at "Codesoft," I not only honed my technical skills but also gained insights into the collaborative and fast-paced nature of professional web development. I am excited to leverage these experiences and contribute to future projects, combining my passion for coding with a commitment to creating seamless and engaging web experiences.
